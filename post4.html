            One of the early projects in the year for me, The Big Spice's hot sauce labels were a great way to stretch the brain muscles. 
            Most of the illustrator files are a complete mess. The designs were originally drawn as sketches in one of my notebooks, and it
            would have been better if they stayed there. I did learn a lot during the assignment though because i had never made something that
            complicated in Adobe Illustrator before.
