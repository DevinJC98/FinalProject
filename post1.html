        <img src="Images/preshrunk.jpg" alt=""mainpost>
        <p> Throughout the year I've worked on several projects in graphic design. During the first year i learned about the basics as well as the use of the adobe suite. 
            The two main assignments I worked on were a logo for my portfolio and a variety of hot sauce labels. Second Semester I learned more about photo manipulation as well 
            as creating a brand.
