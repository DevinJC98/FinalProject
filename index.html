            <h1> 2024 in a nutshell </h1>
            <h2> Heres what i've been up to this year.</h2>
            <p> At the beginning of the year i quit my fulll time job as a sous chef in order to pursue a career in design. Starting in May 2024, I returned to <abbr title="(Southern Alberta Institue of Technology)">SAIT</abbr>
                , attending their Interactive Design Diploma program. I've learned a lot during this time, and as this is one of the last assignments of my first year, i figured it would
                 be fitting to take a look back at a few thing's i've done so far.<p>
