        <h2> 2024 was a wild year...</h2>
        <p> 
            At the beginning of the year I quit my full time job as a sous chef in order to pursue a career in design. Starting in May 2024, I returned to <abbr title="(Southern Alberta Institue of Technology)">SAIT</abbr>
            , attending their Interactive Design Diploma program. I've learned a lot during this time, and as this is one of the last assignments of my first year, it seems fitting that 
            I use this assignment as a way to look back on the year. The quality of the projects I've picked varies as they are from different times 
             in the year, but I am more focused on using this assignment as a reflection, rather than creating a portfolio site. <p>
